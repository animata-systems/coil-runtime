# coil-runtime

Reference implementation of the COIL language runtime.

Parser, AST, semantic validator, execution engine, and SDK interfaces for embedding COIL in a host environment.

## What this is

`coil-runtime` is the canonical implementation of the [COIL specification](https://github.com/animata-systems/coil). It provides:

- **Parser** — tokenizer and AST builder for COIL-C (all dialects)
- **Validator** — preparation-time semantic checks
- **Executor** — deterministic control flow engine
- **SDK interfaces** — contracts for embedding COIL in a host environment
- **Reference implementations** — in-memory providers for development and testing
- **CLI** — `coil` command line tool

## Status

| Layer | Status |
|---|---|
| Parser + AST | Full coverage of stable surface syntax (Core + Extended), all dialects |
| Semantic validator | 3 rules: `exit-required`, `unreachable-after-exit`, `unsupported-operator` |
| Executor | Limited: RECEIVE → stdin, SEND (no modifiers) → stdout, EXIT → return |
| SDK interfaces | `Environment` interface exists; provider interfaces planned |
| Reference implementations | Planned |
| CLI | `coil parse` and `coil run` with `--dialect` flag |
| Conformance suite | 224 tests passing (parser-level) |

The parser covers all operators in the [frozen surface](https://github.com/animata-systems/coil/blob/main/spec/02-core.md): ACTORS, TOOLS, DEFINE, SET, RECEIVE, THINK, EXECUTE, SEND, WAIT, EXIT, IF, REPEAT, EACH, SIGNAL. The conformance suite confirms parser-level contract against the spec test corpus, but does not yet cover full runtime semantics.

## CLI

```bash
coil parse script.coil --dialect path/to/dialect.json  # parse → AST or syntax errors
coil run script.coil --dialect path/to/dialect.json     # execute (limited subset)
```

## SDK interfaces

To embed COIL in your host environment, implement these interfaces:

| Interface | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `ParticipantProvider` | Resolve `@name`, deliver and receive messages |
| `ChannelProvider` | Channels `#name`, routing, replies |
| `ToolProvider` | Resolve `!name`, invoke, arguments, result |
| `ModelProvider` | Resolve `$model` for VIA, call LLM, structured output |
| `BudgetPolicy` | Token, step, and time limits |

## Conformance tests

The [COIL spec repository](https://github.com/animata-systems/coil) contains a conformance test suite in `tests/`. The test suite runs `tests/valid/` and `tests/invalid/` files through the parser.

```bash
npm test
```

A spec-compliant implementation must:
- accept all files in `tests/valid/`
- reject all files in `tests/invalid/` at preparation time

## Dialect support

The runtime operates on construct semantics, not keyword spelling. Dialect support is implemented as a keyword mapping layer on top of the parser. The CLI requires an explicit `--dialect <path>` flag pointing to a JSON dialect table — no built-in dialects (R-0002).

## Design decisions

Implementation decisions (code structure, AST format, parser strategy, CLI behavior) are documented in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) with rationale and trade-offs.
